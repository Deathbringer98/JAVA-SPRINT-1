# Library Management System

# Overview
The Library Management System is a Java application designed to manage a library's catalog, patrons, and borrowing/returning of books. It provides functionalities to add books, authors, and patrons to the library database, as well as borrow and return books by patrons.

# Features
1. Add Data
Books: Add new books to the library catalog with details such as title, author, ISBN, publisher, and number of copies.
Authors: Add information about authors, including their name and birth date.
Patrons: Register patrons by providing their name, address, and contact number.
2. Borrow Books
Patrons can borrow books from the library by selecting from available titles.
The system tracks the number of copies borrowed by each patron and updates the available copies accordingly.
3. Return Books
Patrons can return books they've borrowed, allowing other patrons to borrow them.
The system updates the number of copies returned and makes them available for borrowing again.
4. Display Book Status
Provides a summary of available books, borrowed books, and the number of copies available for each title.
Helps librarians keep track of book availability and manage their inventory effectively.
